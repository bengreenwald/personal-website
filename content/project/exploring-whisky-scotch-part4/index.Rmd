## Part 4: Review Text Analysis
Add introduction. 

## Project Goals
As a reminder, the overarching goals of this mutli-part project are threefold:

* To augment my learning about whisky brands, regions, flavors, and options
* To understand the breadth, depth, and quirks of the scotch whisky industry
* To leverage data to determine which whiskies I ought to try myself

## Review Text Analysis
* text analysis of review description content
* variables of interest: description
* Q: do flavor notes emerge overall? by brand? by type?
* Q: what descriptive words are used commonly to describe scotch?
* sentiment analysis
* groupings of interest: author
* Q: how does sentiment vary across review authors?
* Q: does preference for types or brands vary across review authors?
* Q: with which authors do my tastes align?
