<p>Fantasy football had been a part of my life since my teenage years, but in 2021, I made the decision to step away from the game for the first season in over 15 years. While I was certainly looking forward to refocusing my time spent on fantasy football on other projects, I also knew I’d miss the tradition of connecting and competing with friends over the game.</p>
<p>One thing that made stepping away much easier to swallow: starting an NFL Pick’Em league with friends (and friends of friends) from many of my fantasy leagues over the years. Pick’Em is much simpler than fantasy football: just pick a winner for every NFL game, each week throughout the regular season. The more correct picks, the more points! In our league, we reward the top 2 highest scoring teams with cash every week, plus extra cash for the top 3 teams overall at the end of the season.</p>
<p>As this year’s Pick’Em season came to a close, I started noticing how many teams were finishing the league in different positions than where they began. It got me thinking: what would it look like to visualize the ups and downs of the season? Which teams experienced the most extreme journeys from top to bottom and vice versa?</p>
<p>What resulted was an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize team performance in my Pick’Em league. I sourced the data from ESPN’s app, as well as my own league records managed in Airtable; cleaned and reshaped the data in R; and created a series of visualizations in Tableau. It was a great season, and I was so excited to share the dashboard with my fellow competitors. Can’t wait to play again next year!</p>
